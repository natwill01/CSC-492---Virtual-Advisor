            Hey there!

            A lot has changed since our last update. We have added logging in ability and the ability to create
            an account. Next on the list is finalizing account information input and using that to finalize the
            personalized plan. We have a prototype presentation we are excited to show off everything we have
            so far and our team will be releasing a second press release to the public by next week.

            Stay tuned here for future updates!

        Hello all,
            Progress seems to be halted by some complications with copper and our abilities to publish our changes.
            We are working on fixing the problem to get back up and running. In the mean time we have started with 
            Design Document #2.

        Hello!
        
        Our team has been working hard finalizing our design document #2. While doing so we ran into a few
        problems publishing to the server. These issues have been addressed and fixed and we are ready to
        get back to working hard on the project.

        You may notice a lot of changes on the homepage and more pages start getting added. We are excited
        to add functionality to them and continue to bring updates to our many fans!

        Hey!

        Our team has been away for spring break the past week, but we are rejuvinated and ready to work hard.
        We finished our first deisgn document, and in this we finalized our SQL table structure. This will
        help us move forward as now we can start coding some front end stuff and start making the website
        more presentable.

        We are excited to continue working on the project. Keep looking here for updates in the future!

        Hello!
        
        Since the last update, we have started to organize and create tables for Virtual Advisor's
        database. We also finalized our first press release and it has been put up around campus. 
        There have been a few setbacks due to athletic participation that has made it hard to meet 
        this past week but we plan to get back on top of the ball and moving again soon.

        Hey!

        All team members of Astronomic Ind. are running at full force and ready to start
        laying down the foundation of Virtual Advisor. This week was spent doing the
        necessary paperwork and the press release.

        Coming up next, we plan to get the framework for Virtual Advisor set in place as we now 
        all have our machines set up with GitHub and Microsoft Visual Studio.

        Our team has been working hard at setting up the initial project files and GitHub to
        work hard on the first stages of our Virtual Advisor project.
