        Hello!
        
        Our team has been working hard at setting up the initial project files and GitHub to
        work hard on the first stages of our Virtual Advisor project.
        
        We plan to have all the pages we need initially set up by next week. Our team also plans to
        finish up the SRS Document and have our initial press release sent out to the public.
        
        We are excited to work on this project and hope that users find this website very helpful.

        Hey!

        All team members of Astronomic Ind. are running at full force and ready to start
        laying down the foundation of Virtual Advisor. This week was spent doing the
        necessary paperwork and the press release.

        Coming up next, we plan to get the framework for Virtual Advisor set in place as we now 
        all have our machines set up with GitHub and Microsoft Visual Studio.
